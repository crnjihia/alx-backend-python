# alx-backend-python

This repository contains backend development projects implemented in **Python**, as part of the **ALX Backend Specialization**. Each directory explores fundamental and advanced backend engineering concepts such as generators, asynchronous programming, RESTful APIs, SQL integration, data pipelines, and more.

## 🔍 Project Overview

| Directory | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `python-generators-0x00/` | Efficient data streaming and batch processing using Python generators with SQL integration. |
| *(more to be added)* | *(Additional directories will cover async I/O, API development, ORM, etc.)* |

## 📌 Highlights
- Memory-efficient data processing using `yield`
- Batch and lazy loading from SQL databases
- Real-world data handling with MySQL and CSV
- Modular project structure for scalability

## 📦 Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- MySQL / SQLite
- CSV & SQL Schema Design
- `mysql-connector-python`
- Git & GitHub

## 🛠️ Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/alx-backend-python.git
   cd alx-backend-python
````

2. Navigate to a project folder:

   ```bash
   cd python-generators-0x00
   ```

3. Set up your environment:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python3 seed.py
   ```

## 🧪 Testing

Unit tests for key components are located in each project’s `tests/` directory. Use `unittest` or your preferred Python test runner.
